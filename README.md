# LightbulbSun
(Java-Greenfoot IDE) This is a copy of the game which I developed for college in 2011/12. It is very crudely built using a development environment called GreenFoot. I am, however, very proud of my accomplishment with this. The AI sucks though...

Move - WASD or Arrows
Aim - Move mouse
Shoot - Click
Reload - R or Space Bar

Your objective is to move through the rooms, terminating hostile forces, to find the kidnapped hostage.

Objective 1 - Find the key to the stairwell.
Objective 2 - Fight your way through the second floor to rescue the hostage.

Health-Packs restore all health and respawn.
There are 29 hostiles in this level.

This is a technical demo and the final game will likely not look or play anything like this.

Thanks to the Greenfoot community for their assistance with some of the more complex issues.

Lightbulb Sun - Coming Eventually.
